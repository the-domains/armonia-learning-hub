**Transformation**

The importance to seek transformation through all the activities that we do at Armonía is crucial and at the very core of the founding vision of Saúl and Pilar Cruz, its creation and its history. 

We believe that in order to change the way we live we need to change the way we think, therefore we aim to:

- Encourage different ways of thinking and understanding so to allow the construction of new possibilities and entrepreneurial endeavors with an educated approach to business creation.

Promote opportunities for those that have a passion to generate new projects that can respond to some of the most pressing needs that poverty and marginalization deepen.

Promote creativity and art, and the importance that these have in a collaborative process of learning and business creation.
