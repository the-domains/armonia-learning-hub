**The Importance of continued education that is shared and put in practice.**

One of Armonía's core practices is to learn collectively and to put what we have learned into practice. Although the passion that an entrepreneur in the making needs to be an intrinsic trait, it is true that the impetus for the creation of a new service, product or project needs to be shaped by a sound approach to business modeling, an ability to communicate ones ideas and vision succinctly and clearly, and an ability to work and learn with others.

This ongoing platform will allow members of the Armonía communities, students from the AIMS program, business people, artists and academics to collaborate in strengthening entrepreneurial ideas that can generate profit as well as have a social impact in their local community or in other communities

We hope that in the next few years we can see the growth of businesses with a hybrid commitment that can inspire the creation of more such initiatives.
